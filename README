        'thecut.media',
        'thecut.media.mediasources'
    )


Add ``MEDIA_SOURCES`` and ``THUMBNAIL_ENGINE`` setting::

    MEDIA_SOURCES = [
        'thecut.media.mediasources.models.Image',
        'thecut.media.mediasources.models.Document',
    ]
    THUMBNAIL_ENGINE = 'sorl.thumbnail.engines.pil_engine.Engine'
